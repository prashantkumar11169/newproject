					<p>A PNC mortgage pre-approval means you and your co-borrower’s (if applicable) income, employment and assets have been verified and PNC can issue a firm commitment stating that you are eligible to borrow up to a specified amount, based upon your financial profile. You can enter the information required within the online process using digital verification services or give documentation to your Mortgage Loan Officer at a later time.*</p>

					<p>For most pre-approval inquiries, this process can take an estimated 20-30 minutes to complete.</br></br>

					PNC's digital pre-approval process is not appropriate for all financial profiles. For inquiries by multiple borrowers and others for whom we aren't able to provide an instant decision, we will refer you to a Mortgage Loan Officer who will help complete your request.</br></br>

					*If you are unable to qualify for a mortgage pre-approval, you may still qualify for a mortgage preliminary pre-approval. A mortgage preliminary pre-approval helps you to understand the loan amount you may be eligible to borrow based upon your stated responses to questions around income, employment and assets.</p>
